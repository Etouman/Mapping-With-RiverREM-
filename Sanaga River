# Sanaga River 
The Sanaga River is the longest river in Cameroon. It rises in the Adamawoua region and flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It is on this river that the Country'most important dams projects are located. From this RiverREM, you can clearly visualize the river that separates the Lekie and the Mbam Inoubou divisions. The section illustrated is at the Pont de l'Enfance bridge between the Nachtigal and Mbebe Kikot dams projects.
