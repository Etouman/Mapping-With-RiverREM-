# Estuaire de la Gironde RiverREM
  Navigable since ancient times, the Gironde Estuary is the meeting points of 2 of France's major rivers, The Garonne and the Dordogne. It has a rich history due to the importance of maritime trade. The influence of Bordeaux's Port was long established, attracting many ships
  Realizing a map of what is considered as Europe's largest estuary and its main tributaries was a pleasure for me.
