# Mapping With RiverREM

- This repository contains my maps drawed using River Relative Elevation Model
- This is from an awesome worflow to automate data processing . So you can plug in any DEM and get quick outputs! For all those, I use RiverREM from @Kenneth Larieu  
- Click on each map, to see its high resolution version! 
- Many others maps will be added soon.
